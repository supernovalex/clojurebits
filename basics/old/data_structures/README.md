# data_structures

Revising Clojure data structures as described at https://clojure.org/reference/data_structures.

## Usage

Ensure the leiningen build tools are installed on your operating system. Clone the repository, change directory into it, and then run `lein run`.

There is a single namespace (`data-structures`) in `.../src/data_structures/core.clj`, so you could use clj or any other tooling as you wish. 

## Options

There are no options, this program is just a revision test.

## Examples

`lein run` => `Program exited successfully`

### Bugs

None
